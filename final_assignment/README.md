# Final Assignment for Data Structures Course

This project represents the culmination of the Fall 2017 Data Structures course at Parsons/New School as part of the curriculum for the MS in Data Visualization program. 

This project consisted of 2 final sub-projects building on earlier class assignments:

1. [Alcoholics Anonymous Meeting Data](https://github.com/auchers/data-structures/tree/master/final_assignment/aa). 
 
     * scraping, parsing and geocoding Alcoholics Anonymous meetings from raw text files 
     * designing a new data model 
     * building, maintaining and interfacing with  MongoDB
     * creating a [map-based interface](http://ec2-18-216-148-3.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:4000/aa)
     
2. [Photon Sensor Data](https://github.com/auchers/data-structures/tree/master/final_assignment/sensors).

    * programming a [Particle Photon sensor](https://www.particle.io/) utilizing accelerometer and hall (magnetic) sensors.
    * setting up sensor to collect 1 months worth of data (recording refrigerator activity).
    * designing data model to store sensor readings
    * built, maintain and interface with Amazon RDS. 
    * create API [endpoint](http://ec2-18-216-148-3.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:4000) on Amazon EC2 server to get sensor readings
    * connect sensor data to a prototyped [user interface tracking](https://github.com/auchers/data-structures/tree/master/final_assignment/sensors/dataVisualizationModel.pdf) refrigerator usage.
